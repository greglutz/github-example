How to Contribute
=================

Just fork the original repo at pragmaticlearning/github-example, make your changes and send over a Pull Request.

As a normal civilian, you'll have to wait until the repository's maintainers adjudge your request worthy of
merging; if you *are* a maintainer, you won't have to wait.
